# claude-factory — notes for coding agents

An AI coding factory: YAML **flows** of agent steps (Claude Code / Codex CLI) and shell steps, run
headlessly against git repositories, with a web UI and GitHub watchers. Node.js + TypeScript (ESM),
no frameworks. This repository is **public** — never commit private data, paths or secrets.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci                 # install
npm run build          # TypeScript → dist/ (the CLI runs from dist/)
npm test               # vitest; ~40 s; must pass before anything is committed
node scripts/build-flows.mjs   # regenerate flows/*.yaml (see below)
```

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/engine/` | Runs a flow: steps, jumps, budgets, resume (`runner.ts`, `execute.ts`, `state.ts`) |
| `src/steps/` | Step runners: `claude.ts` (Claude Code CLI), `codex.ts`, `shell.ts` |
| `src/agents/` | Picking agent/provider/model, fallbacks on limits |
| `src/flow/` | Flow schema (zod) and loading; `blocks.ts` for the block library |
| `src/monitor/` | The monitor: detectors, findings store, the `Monitor` check (`detectors.ts`, `work-detectors.ts`, `findings.ts`, `monitor.ts`) |
| `src/queue/` | Scheduler (concurrency, locks), GitHub watchers, dependencies |
| `src/server/` | HTTP API (`api-*.ts`) and the server; the UI calls it |
| `ui/` | Web UI: plain JavaScript modules, no build step, no framework |
| `flows/` | Built-in flows — **generated**, do not edit by hand |
| `blocks/` | Reusable step blocks (YAML) |
| `tools/` | Helper scripts the flows call (`$FACTORY_TOOLS/…`) |
| `scripts/build-flows.mjs` | Generates `flows/*.yaml` from `blocks/` and code |
| `docs/` | `USER_GUIDE.md`, `DESIGN.md` (how it is built), `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, `FLOW_AUTHORING.md` (flow format for AI assistants), `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `tests/` | vitest; `tests/fixtures/` has fake `claude`, `codex` and `gh` |

## Rules

- **Never edit `flows/*.yaml` directly.** Change `scripts/build-flows.mjs` (or `blocks/`), run
  `node scripts/build-flows.mjs`, and commit both.
- **Tests never use real services.** They use the fakes in `tests/fixtures/` (fake `claude`, `codex`,
  `gh` on PATH, a bare git repo as the remote). Extend the fakes when a flow needs a new call.
  `tests/setup.ts` gives every test run a temporary data folder — never read or write the real
  `~/.claude-factory`.
- Every change comes with tests, and `npm run build && npm test` passes.
- **Every API route needs a rule** in `src/server/permissions.ts` and an example in
  `tests/permissions.test.ts`.
- **Add a line to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`** (under "Unreleased") for every change, and update
  `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` when behaviour users see changes. If the flow format changes, update
  `docs/FLOW_AUTHORING.md` too — `tests/guide.test.ts` checks its examples.
- No new dependencies unless the issue asks for one.
- **Keep the test suite fast.** Every story runs it, so its length is the speed of the Foundry. Write
  unit tests (call the function, no server, no git repository, no child process) unless the issue is
  about a flow, the watcher or the server as a whole. Wait for the event you expect, never for a fixed
  time. One test file should finish in a few seconds on a quiet machine; when an end-to-end file grows
  past that, split it or move cases down to unit tests instead of adding to it.
- Security rules: enforce permissions on the server; never put untrusted text (issue text, step
  output, task) into shell commands — use the `$FACTORY_…` environment variables; secrets never
  appear in API responses, logs or agent environments.
- Keep backward compatibility for existing installs (config, runs, flows, watchers, the markers in
  GitHub comments such as `<!-- claude-factory run=… -->`).
- Plain, short English in user-facing text and docs.
